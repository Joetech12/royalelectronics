    The major distinction between VGA and HDMI video cables and ports is that the VGA signal is analog, whereas the HDMI signal is digital. 
    Basically, this means that VGA signals transmit data via electrical wave size while HDMI digital signals send data in the form of bits of data (on or off) at varying frequencies.
    Numerous other distinctions between the two should assist you in determining which cable and converters you need.

    If you're in a hurry, many delectable dishes can be wonderfully steamed or baked in the microwave. You don't have to order takeout just because you forgot to defrost your meats, discovered you're missing a critical ingredient, or don't have time to preheat the oven if you have a microwave at home.
    
    If you're short on time, want to make a hot lunch at work, or simply don't want to bother with a stovetop, here’s a list of seven delicious microwave meals. The best microwave meals and snacks to try when you have time on your hands are listed below.

    Microwaving food with a little water steams it from the inside out. This retains more vitamins and minerals than practically any other form of cooking, demonstrating that microwaved food can be nutritious.
    
    But don't get too wrapped up in the specifics. Vegetables are healthy in almost any form, and the majority of us don't consume enough of them. The microwave is a technological marvel and also very convenient. You will enjoy it!

    p2a1: "VGA",
    p2a2: `VGA, which stands for Video Graphics Array, is one of the oldest analog video connectors available today. 
    Remember the cable in the back of old computers that has a blue connector and screws on both ends? Yep. That’s a VGA cable. You probably have a good chance of having a few VGA cables lying around your house and collecting dust.
    When it was released in 1987, VGA became the standard video cable for computers, and its blue 15-pin connectors easily identify it. 
    The supported resolution was 640x480, but it gradually increased to Ultra Extended Graphics Array (UXGA) in 2007. UXGA could support 15-inch monitors with resolutions of 1600x1200 pixels.

    p3a2: `HDMI, also known as High Definition Multimedia Interface, is a connector and cable that enables high-quality and high-bandwidth audio and video to be streamed between devices. 
    HDMI technology works with HDTV, projector, DVD player, or Blu-ray player devices.
    
    Created in 2002, HDMI became the new computing standard. Its ability to transmit audio in the same cable as the video signal was the main feature that HDMI provided that no other video cable could. HDMI supports 1920x1200 pixel HD video and 8 audio channels.

    p4a1: "VGA Vs HDMI",
    p4a2: `When comparing VGA vs. HDMI, HDMI is the boss because it is newer, supports higher resolutions (HDMI 2.1 supports 10K), has a wider range of refresh rates, and can also carry audio. 
    While some older TVs will work with VGA, it will be more difficult to set up because an audio cable will be required. As a result, HDMI is the preferred connector for televisions.
    VGA is extremely outdated and has little use in today's world. However, it is not completely useless.

    p5a1: "Conclusion",
    p5a2: `You will need to adopt a VGA to HDMI converter to use newer displays on an older computer with only a VGA port. 
    However, you will not enjoy the much better detail and refresh rates provided by a full HDMI port and cable.
    The only time you might need to use a VGA cable is if you still have older devices, such as vintage gaming consoles. In this case, keep a VGA cable and the necessary converters with the device.
    Ultimately, you'll want to replace your TV, desktop, or laptop with a newer model that provides the best video output possible.
